# Movie Reviews Data Wrangling using Python
### My project for Udacity Data Analyst Program


### Description


In this project, i gathered data from different sources and then evaluated data quality and tidiness to finally produce a clean version of it. Lastly i was asked to define a question and answer it through my analysis result using data vizualization libraries


### Used Dataset 

The dataset is already collected from Rotten Tomatoes, which is a premier platform for critic reviews. The site enables users to compare scores given by regular viewers (audience score) and ratings provided by professional critics (tomatometer), who are accredited members of various writing guilds or film critic organizations.

### Libraries 

* NumPy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Requests (to send http requests)
* Zipfile (to manipulate ZIP files)
